        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Poker is a popular card game that combines skill, strategy, and a bit of luck. The game is played with a standard 52-card deck, and the goal is to win chips or money by having the best hand or convincing others that you have the best hand.</p>
        
        <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
        <p>Here are the basic rules of Texas Hold'em, the most popular variant of poker:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each player is dealt two private cards (known as "hole cards").</li>
            <li>Five community cards are dealt face-up on the "board".</li>
            <li>Players use these seven cards to make the best five-card hand.</li>
            <li>The game consists of four betting rounds: Pre-flop, Flop, Turn, and River.</li>
            <li>Players can bet, check, call, raise, or fold during their turn.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Showdown:</strong> If two or more players remain after the final betting round, they reveal their hands, and the player with the best hand wins the pot.</li>
            <li><strong>Fold:</strong> If all but one player folds, the remaining player wins the pot without having to show their hand.</li>
        </ul>
